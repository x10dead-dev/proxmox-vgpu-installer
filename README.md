# vGPU Proxmox Script
This is a little Bash script that configures a Proxmox 8 or 9 server to use Nvidia vGPU's. 
For further instructions see wvthoog's blogpost at https://wvthoog.nl/proxmox-7-vgpu-v3/

## WARNING !!!
- fastapi-dls is not working correctly with v18.x but working fine on v17.x, please consider this for extended use
- 17.6 & 18.1 is download only and only for natively support vGPU, lookup on NVIDIA for supported GPU ([v18.x](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/18.0/product-support-matrix/index.html) & [v17.x](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/17.0/product-support-matrix/index.html))
## Changes
Changes in version 1.2
- Added support for Proxmox 9.
- Removed support for Proxmox 7.
- Removed kernel pinning as it's no longer necessary.
- Integrated `pve-nvidia-vgpu-helper` for a more robust setup.
- Updated the host driver installation method and its service.
- Updated supported vGPU driver versions to 18.3, 18.4, and 19.0. Check [PVE Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/NVIDIA_vGPU_on_Proxmox_VE#Software_Versions).
- Removed support for older driver versions (16.x, 17.0).
- Switched from `megadl` to `wget` for downloading drivers from new URLs.
